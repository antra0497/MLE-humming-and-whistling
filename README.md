# The MiLe End Hums and Whistles Machine Learning Project

This year at Queen Mary University of London we are going to create a new dataset consisting of labelled audio recordings. Each
audio recording will consist of a unique interpretation of a small fragment of 8 iconic movie song.

We will consider fragments of approximately 15 seconds of duration from 8 songs.
The name of the songs, the label we will use to identify them (in parenthesis, bold font) and
an link to an online resource where you can listen to them are listed below:

- Harry Potter theme song (Potter)
https://youtu.be/Htaj3o3JD8I?t=0
- The Imperial March (StarWars)
https://youtu.be/s3SZ5sIMY6o?t=9
- Pink Panther theme song (Panther)
https://youtu.be/lp6z3s1Gig0?t=10
- Singing in the rain (Rain)
https://youtu.be/D1ZYhVpdXbQ?t=65
- Hakuna Matata (Hakuna)
https://youtu.be/MBIWFTXQbi4?t=79
- Mamma Mia (Mamma)
https://youtu.be/unfzfe8f9NI?t=50
- This is me (Showman)

- Let it go (Frozen)

### Data Interpretations
We will record two types of interpretations of the above mentioned songs:
- Humming.
- Whistling.

There is no right or wrong way of humming or whistling to a song. When recording ourself, we just hum or whistle as you would normally do (da-da-da, la-la-la, hm-hm-hm, ti-ro-ri, pa-rapaâ€¦). We did not sing the lyrics.

### Jupyter Notebooks
Basic solution :
> Using the MLEnd Hums and Whistles dataset, build a machine learning pipeline that takes as an input a Potter or a StarWars audio segment and predicts its song label (either Harry or StarWars).

Advanced solution : 
> Formulate a machine learning problem that can be attempted using the MLEnd Hums and Whistles dataset and build a solution model.
